## Clean-LocalProfiles

Reviving and old script idea that I now want to split into two functions that use approved PowerShell verbs.

### Get-InactiveProfiles
Get old local profiles on Windows computers without touching profiles that might need to stay (eg: local admins, built-in accounts, and service accounts).

### Remove-OldProfiles

Clean old local profiles on Windows computers without touching profiles that might need to stay (eg: local admins, built-in accounts, and service accounts).

## Clear-TempFiles

Clear files from temporary folders (current user, all users, system).

### Clear-ExchangeLogs

### Clear-IISLogs

### Compress-ExchangeLogs

### Compress-IISLogs

Other ideas? I'm not looking to replace anything like the [great tools created by @Belim]([url](https://github.com/builtbybel)https://github.com/builtbybel).
