# TheCleaners

## Synopsis

The Cleaners will clean up your server for you!

## Description

A module to help automate the cleanup of old log files and temp files on your systems.

## Why

For all those hours spent manually clearing old IIS logs, Exchange logs, and temp files when a server disk gets low on space. For those teammates who get woken up at night while on call because a disk hit 90% full. For the fun of writing something useful in PowerShell that will hopefully make somebody's day easier!
